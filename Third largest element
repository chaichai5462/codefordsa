Third largest element in an array of distinct elements
Given an array of n integers, the task is to find the third largest element. All the elements in the array are distinct integers. 

Examples : 

Input: arr[] = {1, 14, 2, 16, 10, 20}
Output: 14
Explanation: Largest element is 20, second largest element is 16 and third largest element is 14

Input: arr[] = {19, -10, 20, 14, 2, 16, 10}
Output: 16
Explanation: Largest element is 20, second largest element is 19 and third largest element is 16 

// C++ program to find the third largest
// element in an array.
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int thirdLargest(vector<int> &arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    
    // Sort the array 
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    
    // Return the third largest element 
    return arr[n-3];
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {1, 14, 2, 16, 10, 20};
    cout << thirdLargest(arr) << endl;

    return 0;
}
